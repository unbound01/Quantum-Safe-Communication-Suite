RESPECTED DIRECTOR,

REF: F.No.12-34/2025-QSC

With reference to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) directive dated 15th July 2025 regarding the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards across all government communications, I am pleased to inform you that our department has successfully completed the pilot deployment of the Unified Quantum-Safe Communication Suite.

The implementation includes:

1. PQC Email Gateway with hybrid TLS (X25519 + ML-KEM768)
2. PQC PDF Signer using ML-DSA (Dilithium)
3. Immutable Receipts Service for non-repudiation

As per the directive, all sensitive communications must transition to quantum-resistant algorithms by December 2025. Our successful pilot demonstrates readiness for full-scale deployment.

A detailed report will be presented at the upcoming Inter-Departmental Cybersecurity Meeting scheduled for 25th August 2025.

Kindly acknowledge receipt of this communication.

Regards,

Joint Secretary
Department of Quantum-Safe Communications
Government of India
